# Material-UI Portfolio

Another portfolio built using [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)

## In progress

## Built with
* React
* ReactDOM
* Webpack
* babel-loader

## Get started

```
npm install
```
When you make changes to `/src/App.js`, run webpack to build the bundle file:
```
webpack
```
Webpack will build `/bin/app.bundle.js` using the `webpack.config.js` file.
